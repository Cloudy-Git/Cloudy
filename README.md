With data stored online, traditional computer forensics is quickly becoming obsolete. There are certain artifacts  that are important on a suspectâ€™s machine. However, the main data source is moved to the cloud . In addition to user file data, the cloud stores communication data between users such as e-mails and multi-media messages. This data creates strong evidence against a suspect who has malicious messages sent to and from their account. While the cloud is available to everyone, it is locked. Typically, with user credentials. This creates many problems for the digital forensics community, and thus the exploration of such problems in this paper. 
	Having data stored online, increases the chance of criminal activity evidence stored in the cloud. With a proper court order, cloud providers would be best to extract user data (Federici, 2014). However, most service providers lack this service. Such requests would take weeks, to months to complete. Therefore, we must adapt to pulling data using the high-level APIs exposed by the service providers. Professional forensic applications do exist for this type of problem. However, they lack the ability to perform two fundamental features, which fix necessary problems with cloud forensics. Server-side data filtration, and password-less authentication. While this paper discusses a full software solution, these two problems will be the two main aspects discussed.
